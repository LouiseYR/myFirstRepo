    <p>So today I am going to have a productive day. Right now I am in IT Skills learning new things about computers. I am finding vs code very interseting and fun. I plan to go to the gym after youthreach as i havent been in awhile. </p>
    <p>After the gym i am going to spend some time with my nanny and then go home and clean the house. I find cleaning very relaxing and theraputic. Im very tired today so i will have an early night</p>
